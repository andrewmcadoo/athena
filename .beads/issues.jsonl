This is NOT a parameter sensitivity — it is a fixed sigmoid saturation curve hitting a hard-coded ceiling. S6 joint-compression failures may share this root cause (high bf_strong pushes component scores past the same ceiling).\n\nInvestigation needed:\n1. Determine what BayesFactor values the DSL environment actually produces. If BF\u003e110 is common, the ceiling must move. If rare, document as an accepted operating constraint.\n2. Decompose S6 failures: are they caused by the 0.991 ceiling (same root cause as S5) or by the dominant_share sub-criterion independently?\n3. Evaluate architectural options: (a) raise ceiling (changes normalization contract), (b) clamp BF inputs before normalization (preprocessing step), (c) accept constraint with documented operating bounds.\n4. Whichever option is chosen, quantify the impact on S2 compounding margin (the ceiling change must not break the +7.28% S2 result).\n\nThis blocks the stretch analyses (athena-e2a) — no point running calibration/correlation tests if the ceiling changes the normalization layer.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-22T19:38:40Z","created_by":"andrewmcadoo","updated_at":"2026-02-22T21:34:59Z","closed_at":"2026-02-22T21:34:59Z","close_reason":"S5 ceiling analysis complete.
